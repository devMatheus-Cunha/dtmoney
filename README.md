## ðŸš€ Technologies, Hooks and Libraries

Project developed with the following technologies:

- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- useState (hook that stores data that can vary with time, any information or data must be stored in the useState, only then it will be possible to render the information to the web or mobile frontend)
- useEffect (hook used to control the execution of a function from the change of a certain parameter)
- Context API (shares state between various application components, uses the useContext() hook)
- Styled Components (library that allows you to write CSS code inside Javascript)
- Firebase (using Email/Password authentication and Realtime Database to store data and consume it)
- React Modal (library that renders its child content over a backdrop component and provides many features related to the interaction of these two)
- Polished (library that has optimized styling functions for use in JavaScript, such as darken and transparentize)
